# Spotify-Song-Recommendation-System
This project investigates the drivers of song popularity on Spotify using a dataset of 10,000 top songs from 1950 to the present. Through exploratory data analysis and K-Means clustering, it identifies key patterns in audio features and song similarities. Classification models (Random Forest, LightGBM) are used to predict popularity, while a content-based recommendation system leveraging cosine similarity, sentiment analysis, lyrics, and artist data enhances music discovery and playlist curation. The work provides data-driven insights for improving user engagement and supporting artists and labels.
